# Quantum Field Simulator

## Introduction
This source code simulates the quantum field theory.
Inititially it was developed to simulate the double slit experiment.
It uses a simple motion formula to simulate the light wave.
By defining the slits in the simulator, the interference patterns can be simulated.
Even walls/mirrors can be defined freely in 3D quantum field.
There are also other files to simulate, for example rain drops or detecting the speed of light.
This simulator does not approximate the real world values, but rather simulates the properties of the light wave due to a lack of CPU/GPU power.

I am not claiming that this is THE quantum field theory, but it should only be used for educational purposes to understand the concept of quantum field theory.

<p>The game library engine <a href="https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl3/releases" target="_blank">LWJGL</a> is used to draw the field in 3D.</p>

### Sample files:
* double_slit.qfs
* rain.qfs
* test_speed_of_light.qfs

### Compilation
* IDE: Eclipse
* Compiler: Java 1.8

<p>Download the project to any folder. Then from the File menu in Eclipse click on "open Projects from File System..." and import the downloaded project folder.</p>
<p>Find the file Main.java and run.</p>
<p>Make sure you have Java 8 installed. JDK 8 or later is recommended.</p>

<p>
  I am not a physicist and I have very little knowledge of the formulas used as shown in Wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Quantum field theory</a>.
  But I have discovered that the formula above works very well for simulating any waves and double slit experiments.

  The equation above is simply derived from the physics motion formula.
  Have a look at the QFSNode.java source code to see how this formula is derived and used in the code.
  Note that this is not the full quantum field formula, only the electric field is simulated.
  Note that v is not the speed of light, but is actually the speed of the node itself.
  The propagation of the light wave is caused by the motion of the node and the variable k determines the speed of light.
