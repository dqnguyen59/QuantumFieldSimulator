# QuantumFieldSimulator

## Introduction
Quantum Field Simulator is a cross-platform simulator to simulate the quantum field theory. Inititially it was developed to simulate the double slit experiment, but I beleave it can do more than that as long as the cpu can handle it. The game library engine LWJGL is used to draw the field in 3D.

IDE: Eclipse
Compiler: Java 1.8

In Eclipse, import Projects from File System or Archive and select the folder.
