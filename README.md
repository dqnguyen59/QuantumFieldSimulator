# Quantum Field Simulator

## Introduction
This source code simulates the quantum field theory.
Initially it was developed to simulate the double slit experiment.
It uses a simple motion formula to simulate the light wave.
By defining the slits in the simulator, the interference patterns can be simulated.
Even walls/mirrors can be defined freely in 3D quantum field.
There are also other files to simulate, for example rain drops or detecting the speed of light.
This simulator does not approximate the real world values, but rather simulates the properties of the light wave due to a lack of CPU/GPU power.

I am not claiming that this is The formula for quantum field theory, but it should only be used for educational purposes to understand the concept of quantum field theory.<br/>

<p>
  I have a little knowledge of the formulas used as shown in Wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Quantum field theory</a>, but after a lot of trials and errors, I've found that the above formula works pretty well for simulating waves and double-slit experiments.

<p>
  The equation above is simply derived from the physics motion formula.
  Have a look at the QFSNode.java source code to see how this formula is derived and used in the code.
  Note that this is not the full quantum field formula, only the electric field is simulated.
  Note that v is not the speed of light, but is actually the speed of the node itself.
  The propagation of the light wave is caused by the motion of the node where each node influences the neighboring nodes.
  The variable k determines the speed of light.
